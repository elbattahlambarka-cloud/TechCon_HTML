            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of technology enthusiasts in a community center. What started as a modest event with just 200 attendees has now grown into one of the most anticipated technology conferences globally.</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, TechCon has evolved to keep pace with the rapidly changing tech landscape. From the early days focusing on web development and emerging social media platforms, we've expanded to cover artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>
